# Cough detection with transfer learning for COVID symptom tracker
 Cough detection with Log Mel Spectrogram, Wavelet Transform, Deep learning and Transfer learning concepts.
 
•	A computer vision and deep learning (with transfer learning) framework for detection of cough sounds in the presence of other common household sounds. 
•	Log Mel spectrogram and Wavelet transform images were obtained for sound data samples (ESC-50)
•	A Convolutional Neural Networks based pretrained model "VGG16" was trained on this image dataset to detect cough sounds with high test accuracy.
